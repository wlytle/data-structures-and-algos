# data-structures-and-algos
 This is just a place to keep track of my ongoing and (presumably) never-ending learning on data structures and algorithms. Always happy to chat code and math (and rivers) feel free to reach out for suggestions or conversations (or paddling)!  

 Some Algos have the same solution coded multiple times and commented out. This is just becasue writing things more than once helps my brain hold onto what it did.
