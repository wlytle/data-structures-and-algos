# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).

# Example IO:

# str_compress('access');
# => 'a1c2e1s2'

def str_compress
end
